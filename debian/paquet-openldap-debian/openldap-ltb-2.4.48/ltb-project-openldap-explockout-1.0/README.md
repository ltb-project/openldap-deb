# explockout
OpenLDAP module that denies authentication to users who have previously failed to authenticate, requiring them to wait for an exponential time

## TODO

- improve explockout overlay to apply onlu for certain ppolicy (but it implies a strong interaction with the ppolicy)
- create unit tests
- create a markdown documentation?
