INSTALLATION
============

Build dependencies
------------------
cracklib header files (link with -lcrack). The Makefile does not look for
cracklib; you may need to provide the paths manually.

Build
-----
Use the provided Makefile to build the module.

Copy the resulting check_password.so into the OpenLDAP modulepath.

Or, change the installation path to match with the OpenLDAP module path in the
Makefile and use 'make install'.


USAGE
=====
Add objectClass 'pwdPolicyChecker' with an attribute

   pwdCheckModule: check_password.so

to a password policy entry.

The module depends on a working cracklib installation including wordlist files.
If the wordlist files are not readable, the cracklib check will be skipped
silently. 

But you can use this module without cracklib, just checks for syntatic checks.
